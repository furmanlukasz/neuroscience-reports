 This study explores the analysis of EEG signals to understand brain microstates and their dynamics in schizophrenia. Key aspects include:

1. **Transition Matrix and Graphs**: Creation of transition matrices and directed graphs to quantify and visualize EEG-derived microstate transitions in individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls.

2. **Motif Analysis**: Identification of recurring microstate transition patterns (motifs) within the complex networks, offering insights into neural circuitry differences in schizophrenia.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Utilization of statistical methods to compare motif distributions between groups, highlighting motifs that significantly differ in schizophrenia.

4. **Implications**: The study discusses how certain EEG microstate motifs could serve as potential biomarkers for schizophrenia, aiding in diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.

This research integrates statistical techniques and graph theory.
